## Overview of Analysis

We have been tasked to help Dana build an interactive webpage that provides information about UFO sightings.  This was done using JavaScript and HTML.  On
the webpage we created a dynamic table that allowed users to get informaiton about UFO sightings.  However, Dana would now like to provide a more in depth
analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter through multiple criteria at the same time.  So, we added more search filters to the dynamic table. 
The following search criteria was added: city, state, country and shape.

## Results

### Please find below a screen shot of the new webpage:

Updating the webpage by adding more search options allows users to filter through multiple criteria at the same time.  There are now five (5) search 
filters for users:  1.  Date, 2. City, 3. State, 4. Country, and 5. Shape.  Users can enter in information for one search filter box or all of them in
order to generate more in depth information on UFO Sightings.

## Summary

### Drawback
I would recommend creating a dropdown list in the search filter boxes because having to randomly enter in information could be cumbersome.

### Recommendations
Please find below my recommendations for further development of this webpage:
1.  Adding graphics and videos of the UFO Sightings would be great!
2.  Adding and/or offering more commentary when a search is generated would also attract more users to the site.
