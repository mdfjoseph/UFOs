## Overview of Analysis

We have been tasked to help Dana build an interactive webpage that provides information about UFO sightings.  This was done using JavaScript and HTML.  On
the webpage we created a dynamic table that allowed users to get informaiton about UFO sightings.  However, Dana would now like to provide a more-indepth
analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter through multiple criteria at the same time.  So, we added more search filters to the dynamic table. 
The following search criteria was added: city, state, country and shape.

## Results

Please find below a screen shot of the new webpage.
